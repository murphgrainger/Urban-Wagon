# Modern Trail

### Project Description
My app will be modern day Oregon Trail in a bar setting.  Instead of westward movement, this app encourages interesting conversations between new people and encourages future connections.  It takes the concepts of adventure, the unknown, and unforseen hardships from the original OT game and morphs them into a networking setting. 

###How It Works: 
 * Go to a bar
 * Enter a names of your group as members of the team
 * "Travel the Trail" by meeting new people and completing randomized tasks that pop on your phone.
  * Task Examples (all TBD):
    * Meet three people from three different states in 10 minutes
    * Acquire two business cards in 20 minutes
    * Find someone interested in fencing in 5 minutes
    * Ask a "Would You Rather Question" and see if you have the same answer
 * If you complete the task within the alotted time, you move onto the next conversation, if not a hardship arises, or a hardship could arise at any time.
 * Hardship Examples (all TBD):
   * Tiredness: Stand in the corner alone for 5 minutes.
   * Thirst: Buy a stranger a drink.
   * Extreme Cold: Ask to borrow a strangers article of clothing.
   * Trail Obstruction: Must make a human chain with strangers and move through the room
   * If the person brings up politics, you have to go stand outside the opposite sex bathroom for 5 minutes.
   * If you reach the end of the trail you receive a prize in the form of points, food, drinks, TBD. 

## What problem does this app solve?
Meeting people at bars is very intimidating, awkward, and inefficient. People consistently go to bars and come home without having talked to anyone in their own party.  My app will gamify networking, gain users new friends, and make for amazing stories later on.
