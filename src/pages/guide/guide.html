        General Play
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>
        Your group has to complete a certain number of tasks to reach the end of the trail. You can select a specific player to complete each task, or skip it. Beware, skipping too many tasks may cause a hardship to present itself to a randomized player. You
        lose the game if no one is eligible to complete a task to progress the group.

        Tasks
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>
        Tasks are designed for players to meet new people. They can be anything from asking a "Would You Rather" question, to getting a business card. You can complete, fail, or skip a task. The only way to progress down the trail is to complete tasks.
        Morale increases for the player who completes the task.
